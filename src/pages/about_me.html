            I was born and raised in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Completed my SSC (10th grade) from Monipur High School and College and finished my HSC (12th grade) from Birsreshtha Noor Mohammad Public School and College. Growing up, I was into several things such as football, rubiks cube and similar puzzles, sketch and art, origami, chess etc. and had an unhealthy obsession of watching anime. Immersing my self into different hobbies was really fun growing up. Before my undergraduate program, I started coding in c++ and instantly fell in love with it. The amount of challenges that could be thrown and be solved through coding really fascinated me a lot.

            Currently, I am a 3rd year student at American International University Bangladesh pursuing Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering. At the beginning of my undergraduate, I was hooked into problem solving with programming and I was absolutely fascinated about it. Later down the road, I started learning application development, machine learning and deep learning which not only gave me the thrill of tackling problems and coming up with solutions but it also provided me a purpose. Writing programs that could be used in real life was more enjoyable than anything else I did with programming before. Currently, after learning all the fundamentals and essentials of web application development, I am working on projects to refine the skills I need. I am also progressing in deep learning and really looking forward to make proejcts that merges these two things together.

            Talking about the future is a little tricky, maybe more than little. It is mind blowing how we plan our future in certain ways and how it actually turns out, for better or worse. I like the idea that if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life. Although I do not completely agree with this because you don't get to do only the things you like doing in a demanding job, but there are some truth to it. For me, I really like learning new things, I like to challenge myself with difficult tasks only for the thrill of it, I like implementing what I learn into daily life and I am a big fan of giving my 100% to finish a task in the best way I can even when there are room for loose ends. No matter what role is waiting for me in the future, I hope that these qualities will compliment it whether it is in a job, or a business of mine or leadning a group of people.
